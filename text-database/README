This example simulates reading from a text-based database, or CSV file
(comma-separated value) using a shell script. fahrzeugdatenbank contains
a car database whereas each line describes a single car. A single line
contains of the following fields:

car:colour:horse power:car image file

script10.sh requires two parameters -- the name of the car (field #1),
and the name of the car database file (fahrzeugdatenbank). It validates
the parameters, reads the car database file, and outputs the record.

sample call:

./script10.sh Focus fahrzeugdatenbank
