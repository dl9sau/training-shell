fahrtenbuch collects solutions to read a driver's logfile that has the
following structure

.fahrtenbuch.txt
----
count	from				to			distance	reason
2		Berlin				Potsdam		30			training
2		Frankfurt (Main)	Paris		575			Linux event
1		Berlin				Hamburg		280			training
----

As a result, the total distance is printed. The following versions are
included:

* ./fahrtenbuch.sh

  The script can be called like that:

  ----
  $ ./fahrtenbuch.sh
  ----

* distanz.awk

  The solution as an awk script. The awk script can be called like that:

  ----
  awk -f distanz.awk fahrtenbuch.txt
  ----

  Thanks to Axel Beckert and Thomas Partzsch for help for the awk
  solution.
